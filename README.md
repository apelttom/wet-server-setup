# How to set up Wolfenstein Enemy Territory 2.06b PRO server Docker version
 
You have to allow some udp traffic on ports 27960 - 27970. To do this simply use program ufw and these commands:
    sudo ufw allow 27950:27970/udp
    sudo ufw enable

Then restart the machine

You will probably wanna tweak out the configuration you can find it in the folder source/configs/etpro.cfg You should at least change the ip address of the server. Then proceed with server startup.

### First step: Build docker image
docker build -t tapeltauer/etpro .

### Second Step: Run the server in docker, detached and with port forwarding
docker run -d -p 27950-27970:27950-27970/udp --name wolf_applestain tapeltauer/etpro

### Enjoy the game!

## You might need some of these commands

>Command to start the server after stopping

docker stop wolf_applestain

>Command to start the server after stopping

docker start wolf_applestain

>Command to run the server detached and autorestart on failure

docker run --restart=always -d -p 27950-27970:27950-27970/udp --name wolf_applestain tapeltauer/etpro
